dotfiles
========

I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want. If you are looking for sourcecode, I can tell you I don't have much. But what I do have are a very particular set of dotfiles; configurations that I have acquired over not a very long career. These dotfiles make me a nightmare for people like you. If you leave this repo now, that'll be the end of it. I will not look for you, I will not pursue you. But if you don't, I will look for you, I will find you, and I will fork your projects.
